#Process of the project
## Week 1
### Day 1 , monday 09-01-2017
The first option was to visualize the school enrolment of children per country over several years. However, when there was not a lot of data available I've changed the subject to CO2 emissions of countries, which will be visualized using a world map, sunburst and a barchart. In the barchart the produced energy per country will be shown, to give some positive additional information. 

### Day 2, tuesday 10-01-2017
When inspecting the chosen data, I figured that the energy will not be that interesting. Instead, I will show the urbanization of people in the countries, as this is denoted as an influential factor in rising CO2 emission levels in literature.  The sunburst and worldmap will remain, only the third visualization willl probably change. 

### Day 3, wednesday 11-01-2017
I'm going to form a JSON file and decide which functions I'll write.
